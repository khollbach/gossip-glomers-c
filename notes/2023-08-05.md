## Accomplishments 🏆

- Figured out `reliable_send` / `reliable_recv` requirements (see **Recap** below)!

## Recap ⏪

We are going to implement a general `reliable_send` / `reliable_recv` framework such that every node has access to this API relative to every other node in the network.

In our application code, we just need to switch `msg_send` and `msg_recv` out for `reliable_send` and `reliable_recv`, respectively, in the handlers / dispatchers.

### Any Node

#### as Sender

**Structures**

- [ ] Queue for _each_ peer (this node as a message _sender_)

**`reliable_send` Steps**

1. Append new message to tail of queue
2. Peek at head of queue message, and check `last_sent_ts`
3. Send that message with index of message if `current_ts - last_sent_ts >= 100 ms`
4. Return to event loop[^1]

#### as Receiver

**Structures**

- [ ] State tracker for _each_ peer (this node as a message _receiver_)

**`reliable_recv` Steps**

```
if i <= largest_seen_i:
    just ACK
elif i == largest_seen_i + 1:
    send ACK
    largest_seen_i += 1
    yield message to appropriate application code
else: # ACK_i received
    if ACK_i <= largest_ACKed_i:
        pass
    else:
        ACKed_msg_i, _ = queue.dequeue(node's queue of messages to be sent)
        assert ACKed_msg_i == ACK_i
        largest_ACKed_i += 1
```

## TODOs 📝

- [ ] **Kevan**: Look into TDD approaches
- [x] **Ravi**: Implement hash table, dynamic array

[^1]: We are relying on `reliable_recv` to change the state of the queue and state tracker upon receiving ACK
