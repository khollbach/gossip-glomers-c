# Dev Notes

2023-08-08

## Accomplishments üèÜ

- Review dictionary implementation together; minor enhancements to `collections.c`
- Broke ground on `tcp.{c,h}`

## Recap ‚è™

**`msg_send_pusher` Steps**

1. Append new message to tail of queue

**`msg_recv_listener` Steps**

Event loop that only returns when a _new data_ message is received.
Until then:

- It is "ACK"-ing _data_ messages it's already seen
- Incoming "ACK"s:
  - If incoming "ACK" sequence index matches the sequence index at the head of the sending queue, dequeue from sending queue
  - If incoming "ACK" sequence index _doesn't_ match the sequence index at the head of the sending queue, noop

### ACK schema

```json
{
  "src": "us",
  "dest": "them",
  "body": { "type": "ACK", "seq_msg_index": 0 }
}
```

## TODOs üìù

- [ ] **Kevan**: Look at Github Issues for more info
- [ ] **Kevan**: Refactor json obj creation dup'd code (`generate_ACK_msg`)
- [ ] **Kevan**: Test the current two-node impl, using mael's echo workload
- [ ] **Ravi**: Work on dictionary TODOs

### Backlog

- Generalize single-channel framework (`tcp.c`) to arbitrary number of pairwise relationships:
  - Each instance/node keeps a hashtable of channels (keyed on `node_id`)
  - For msgs pushed via reliable_send, look at the dest field, and lookup that channel state
  - For msgs we recv, look at the src field, and use the corresponding state
